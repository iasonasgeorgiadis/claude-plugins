# Scan Project Context

Perform a high-level analysis of the project's CLAUDE.md file(s) to help developers quickly understand the codebase.

## Your Task

1. **Locate CLAUDE.md Files**
   - Search for CLAUDE.md files in the project root and any subdirectories
   - If no CLAUDE.md is found, inform the user and suggest creating one

2. **Analyze Document Structure**
   - Identify all main sections and headings
   - Note the overall organization and structure of the documentation

3. **Extract Key Information**
   - **Project Scope**: Identify the project's purpose, goals, and main functionality
   - **Architecture Overview**: Note any architectural patterns or design principles mentioned
   - **Key Conventions**: Extract coding standards, naming conventions, or best practices
   - **Important Context**: Identify any critical information developers should know

4. **Identify Dependencies**
   - List main frameworks, libraries, and tools mentioned
   - Note any specific versions or configuration requirements
   - Identify development tools and build systems

5. **Present Structured Analysis**

   Format your response as follows:

   **📋 Project Context Analysis**

   **Overview**
   - Brief summary of what this project is and does
   - Primary technology stack

   **Document Structure**
   - List of main sections found in CLAUDE.md

   **Key Information**
   - Essential context for developers working on this project
   - Architectural patterns or design principles
   - Important conventions or standards

   **Dependencies & Tools**
   - Frameworks and libraries
   - Development tools
   - Build systems or package managers

   **Quick Start Reference**
   - Links to relevant sections in CLAUDE.md for deeper exploration

## Guidelines

- Focus on providing a clear, scannable overview
- Use bullet points and sections for easy reading
- Highlight the most important information for someone new to the project
- If CLAUDE.md is very large, prioritize the most relevant sections
- Be concise but comprehensive - aim for information density
